# Computer-Vision-for-Elementary-Education

The goal of this project is to create modules that teach children some elementary education using computer vision. This allows kids to learn in a fun way using their toys.

## Module 1: Object Counting
This module will count objects i.e. toys in a given image. This can be used to teach kids counting and basic math. For example;
![](iqra-toys.jpg)
Given an image like above, the program will give answer as 4.
To teach counting, a kid can add or remove toys from the frame and count will go up and down respectively.
To teach math, a question will pop up such as 2+2 and the kid will place that many toys in the picture so computer can respond if the answer (i.e. frame) is correct or not.
### Current work
